*      .CM FILE TYPE SCHEMA     *
*********************************


In CueMonkey, each project can be saved as a .cm file which at its core is a XML file.
The contents of this file document the different tags used and the meta data expected from a .cm file


<CueMonkey>

  The <CueMonkey> Tag is the parent element for the file. If it is missing from a file then the .cm file is not valid

<Project_Meta_Data>
